## What next?

* Change the messages the player receives when they press the right or wrong button
* Allow the player to play again if they lose, without having to press F5 to run the program again
* Add a 'streak' counter which adds one every time a light is turned off, and tells the user how many lights they successfully turned off in a row when they lose the game
* Change the amount of time the player has to turn the light off to be a randomly chosen number
* Allow the user to choose a difficulty level, and alter the time they are allowed depending on the difficulty level they chose
* Change your game to use the capacitive touch inputs on the Explorer HAT (5-8) so that instead of pressing the buttons, the user might have to press a banana, marshmallow, jelly baby, or another capacitive touch object
