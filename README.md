# Lights Out!

![](cover_make.png)

In this resource you can find out how to make a fast paced fun reaction game using the Explorer HAT. 

The Explorer HAT has touch buttons labelled 1-4, and four LED lights in different colours. The **aim of the game** is to code the Explorer HAT to randomly choose a light to turn on, and the user must press the corresponding button to turn the light off. If the player is too slow or if they press the wrong button, the game is over.  

## Requirements
