## Setting up 

Before you start, make sure your Raspberry Pi is powered down and switched off. 

- Carefully mount the Explorer HAT onto the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi, then boot the Pi.

- Open Python 3 from the Programming menu:

- Create a new file by clicking **File** > **New File** and type the code `import explorerhat` before pressing **F5** to run your program.

If everything is working you should see a message saying "Explorer HAT Pro detected...". If not, check that you have [installed the software](what-you-will-need), and that you have connected your Explorer HAT correctly to the GPIO pins.
