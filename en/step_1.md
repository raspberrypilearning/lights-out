## What you will make
In this resource you will find out how to make a fun and fast-paced reaction game using the Explorer HAT.

The Explorer HAT has touch buttons labelled from 1 to 4, and four LED lights in different colours. The aim of the game is to program the Explorer HAT to turn a light on at random, at which point the player must press the corresponding button to turn the light off. If the player is too slow, or if they press the wrong button, the game is over.

## What you will learn
By creating this project with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to control lights on the Explorer HAT
- How to detect when a button is pressed and which button was pressed
- How to generate random numbers
- How to simulate a timer using Python
